# SwiftWizard
SwiftWizard is a tool for encoding and decoding LPC speech synthesis bitstreams that can be read by the TMS5220 chip.
The program is based entirely on [BlueWizard](https://github.com/patrick99e99/BlueWizard), a smiliar tool written in Objective-C by patrick99e99.

SwitWizard is still currently in development, and I am writing it just for fun and personal use.
